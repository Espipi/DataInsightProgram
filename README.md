## I. Project 1: COVID-19 Data analysis
# Introduction
Discovered in China, the SARS-COV 2 coronavirus is challenging the entire world, including the world's major economies. This pandemic continues to spread throughout the world and in the various countries already affected. Almost 3.6 million confirmed cases with 257,000 deaths have been officially reported on the site of the World Health Organization. As for Africa, it recorded 27,973 confirmed cases, i.e. 0.86% of the number of confirmed cases in the world. 
Through this study, we make a brief summary of the situation in two African countries (Ghana and Rwanda) in order to highlight the feelings of the populations on the difficult current situation.

# Datasets used
For this report, we use two databases: a quantitative database from https://covid.ourworldindata.org and a qualitative database from a survey on https://data.humdata.org. This analysis will be done on two countries:  Ghana and Rwanda. We have extracted from the two global databases the parameters measured for these two countries.
